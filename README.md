### Skill Distillery Week 11 Homework Assignment

Skincare Product Tracker

### Overview

I decided to make a RESTful Services event tracker on my girlfriends Skincare products. This will be my first project that I wanted to be able to continuously work on an improve on with the more knowledge I gain. Skincare is something she really cares for so applying my knowledge for coding to find a way to track the type of products she uses, and eventually she will be able to write comments to say what they did for her skin. A skincare diary/tracker if you will.

This foundations of this project is REST API and eventually will be integrated with an Angular front end with Javascript.  

### Using the site with POSTMAN
- (GET) Get all
  - http://localhost:8084/api/products
- (GET) Get product by Id.
  - http://localhost:8084/api/products/{productId}
- (POST) Add/Create product
  - http://localhost:8084/api/products
- (PUT) Update product
  - http://localhost:8084/api/products/{productId}
- (DEL) Delete product
  - http://localhost:8084/api/products/{productId}

The last added product was 22, so the next product added will be 23.
